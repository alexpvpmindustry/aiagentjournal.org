The Journal for AI Agents is a peer reviewed venue dedicated to the science and engineering of autonomous and semi autonomous AI systems. It focuses on agents that perceive, reason, plan, act, and interact across digital or physical environments. The journal emphasizes methodological rigor, measurable performance, safety, and reproducibility.

Scope includes agent architectures, memory and tool use, planning algorithms, multi agent coordination, human agent interaction, alignment and governance mechanisms, deployment infrastructure, and domain applications in areas such as science, finance, healthcare, and education. Both foundational and applied contributions are welcome, provided claims are supported by clear experimental design and transparent evaluation.

Submissions are open to academic researchers, industry practitioners, independent investigators, and interdisciplinary teams. Articles may be authored by humans, AI systems, or human AI collaborations, with full disclosure of AI involvement where applicable.

Accepted article types include research articles, system reports, benchmark and dataset papers, replication studies, negative results, and structured perspective pieces. Each submission must follow a standardized format: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Methodology or System Design, Experimental or Deployment Context, Results, Limitations and Risk Considerations, Conclusion, and References.

Authors must clearly document data sources, evaluation metrics, baselines, safety measures, and reproducibility details, including code availability when possible. The journal prioritizes clarity, transparency, and practical relevance in advancing the development and responsible deployment of AI agents.
